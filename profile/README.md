## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Public repository for everyone in the team


- Have 3 repositories (frontend, backend, ML)
- .yml and PR templates setup (change from md to yml)
- create teams (frontend, backend)
- branch protection rules
- PR review rules
- other rules (especially for onboarding)
- wiki (for onboarding)
- labels
- Create multiple milestones (App v1.0 vs AI v1.0)
- Create 1 project for each sprint (include both app and AI development tasks) - at the end of each sprint, discuss what we want to implement from the backlog in the next sprint
- Create 1 project backlog (all features that we want to implement)
